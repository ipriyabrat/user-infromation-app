# User Information management website
I have built a User Information management website where people can easily store their required data. On this website, I have provided a list of options for storing data, and I have also added the login functionality so that people can keep their information securely.

The motivation behind this project is that, at present, people have needs like Aadhaar number, Bank account number in day to day life."People don't have time to look for or to keep." With all the information in place, he will get the information he needs in a short time.
